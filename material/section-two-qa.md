# Section 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## Quiz Questions
1.  **What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?**

*Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.*
    
2. **What is a class in Python?**

*A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have.*
    
3.  **How do you create an object of a class in Python?**
    
*To create an object of a class in Python, you use the class name followed by parentheses. For example, `my_object = MyClass()` creates an object named `my_object` from the `MyClass` class.*
    
4.  **What is the purpose of constructors in Python classes?**
    
*Constructors are special methods in Python classes that are used to initialize the attributes of an object. They are executed automatically when an object is created.*
    
5.  **What is inheritance in OOP?**
    
*Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. It allows the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes and facilitates code reuse.*
    
6.  **What is method overriding in Python?**
    
*Method overriding is a feature of OOP that allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The subclass overrides the behavior of the inherited method.*
    
7.  **What is encapsulation in OOP?**
    
*Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods together within a class. It hides the internal implementation details of an object and provides public interfaces for interacting with the object.*
    
8.  **What is the difference between an instance variable and a class variable?**
    
*An instance variable is specific to an instance (object) of a class and has different values for different objects. A class variable, on the other hand, is shared among all instances of a class and has the same value for all objects.*
    
    
9.  **How does Python support multiple inheritance?**
    
*Python supports multiple inheritance, which means a class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. It is achieved by listing the parent classes in the class definition, separated by commas.*
