## Steps
1.  **Check Python Version:**
    - Open the Terminal application. You can find it by searching for "Terminal" in Spotlight or navigating to Applications → Utilities → Terminal.
    - Type `python --version` and press Enter.
    - macOS usually comes with a pre-installed version of Python. This step will help you determine if Python is already installed and its version. If you see a version number (e.g., Python 2.7.x or Python 3.9.x), you can proceed to step 5. If Python is not installed or you want to install a different version, continue to step 2.

2.  **Download Python:**
    - Visit the official Python website at [Python](https://www.python.org/).
    - Click on the "Downloads" tab.
    - Scroll down to the section titled "Python Releases for macOS" and click on the "Download Python" button for the latest version (e.g., Python 3.X.Y).
    - You may see different versions (e.g., Python 3.8, Python 3.7) available. Choose the one you prefer, but it's generally recommended to use the latest stable version.

3.  **Run the Installer:**
    - Once the installer is downloaded, locate the file (e.g., python-3.X.Y-macosx10.9.pkg) and double-click on it to run the installer.
    - You may see a security prompt asking if you want to open the file. Click "Open" to proceed.
    - The installer will launch, and you'll see the Python Installer welcome screen. Click "Continue" to proceed.
    - Read the License Agreement, and if you agree, click on the "Continue" button.
    - In the next screen, you can select the installation location. The default location is usually fine. Click on the "Install" button to begin the installation process.
    - You may be prompted to enter your administrator password. Provide the password and click "Install Software".

4.  **Wait for Installation:**
    - The installer will now copy the necessary files and install Python on your system. This process may take a few minutes.
    - You'll see a progress bar indicating the installation progress.
    - Once the installation is complete, you'll see a screen with the message "The installation was successful."
    - Click on the "Close" button to exit the installer.

5.  **Verify Python Installation:**    
    - Open a new Terminal window.
    - Type `python3 --version` and press Enter.
    - You should see the Python version number printed on the screen, indicating that Python is successfully installed.
    - Note the use of `python3` instead of `python` to ensure you're using Python 3.X.
