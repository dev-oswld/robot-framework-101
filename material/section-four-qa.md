# Section 4: Introduction to Robot Framework

## Quiz Questions
1.  **What is Robot Framework?**

Robot Framework is an open-source, generic test automation framework that uses a keyword-driven approach. It provides a simple and readable syntax for creating test cases and supports a wide range of application testing, including web, desktop, and API testing.

2.  **What is the file extension used for Robot Framework test cases?**

The file extension used for Robot Framework test cases is `.robot`. Test cases are written in plain text format and organized into test suite files with the `.robot` extension.

3.  **What is a test suite in Robot Framework?**

A test suite in Robot Framework is a collection of related test cases grouped together. It helps organize and manage tests effectively, allowing you to execute multiple test cases as a single entity.

4.  **What are keywords in Robot Framework?**

Keywords in Robot Framework are the building blocks of test cases. They represent actions or functions that perform specific tasks, such as interacting with user interfaces, making API calls, or verifying results.

5.  **How do you define a test case in Robot Framework?**

In Robot Framework, test cases are defined using the `Test Case` section header followed by a name. Test steps and keywords are then written below the test case name, using indentation to indicate the hierarchy.

6.  **How do you run test cases in Robot Framework?**

Test cases in Robot Framework can be executed using the `robot` command followed by the path to the test suite file. For example, `robot path/to/test_suite.robot` runs the test cases in the specified test suite file.

7.  **What are variables in Robot Framework?**

Variables in Robot Framework are used to store and manage data that can be used across test cases or within a single test case. They allow for dynamic and reusable values in test automation.

8.  **How do you define a variable in Robot Framework?**

Variables in Robot Framework are defined using the `Set Variable` or `Set Global Variable` keywords, followed by the variable name and its value. For example, `Set Variable ${username} admin` defines a variable named `${username}` with the value `admin`.

9. **How does Robot Framework handle test data?**

Robot Framework allows the use of test data tables for parameterizing test cases. Test data tables can be defined using the `|` separator, and different data sets can be used to drive the test cases.

10.  **Can you customize the report and log files generated by Robot Framework?**

Yes, Robot Framework provides options to customize the report and log files generated during test execution. You can specify output file names, formats, and other settings using command-line options or configuration files.
