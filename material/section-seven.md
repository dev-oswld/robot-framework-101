# Section 7: Project Work and Practical Exercises
We will apply the knowledge gained from previous sections to work on a project and complete practical exercises.

## Content

### Project Scope and Requirements
Understanding the project scope and requirements is essential for successful implementation. It involves analyzing the project's objectives, identifying the automation requirements, and defining the scope of work.

> Example
- Project Objective: Automate the login and registration functionality of a web application.
    - Requirements:
        - Verify successful login with valid credentials.
        - Validate error messages for invalid login attempts.
        - Test user registration functionality.

### Test Planning and Strategy
Test planning and strategy involve defining a comprehensive approach to testing the application. It includes determining the test coverage, test environment setup, and test execution timeline.

> Example
- Test Coverage:
    - Login functionality - Positive and negative scenarios.
    - Registration functionality - Successful and unsuccessful attempts.
- Test Environment Setup:
    - Web browser: Chrome.
    - Test data: Test usernames and passwords.
    - Test data source: CSV file.

### Test Case Design and Development
Test case design and development involve creating detailed test cases based on the project requirements. It includes identifying test steps, expected results, and test data.

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Verify Successful Login
    [Documentation]  Test case to verify successful login
    [Tags]  login
    Open Browser  ${url}  chrome
    Input Text  ${username_field}  ${valid_username}
    Input Password  ${password_field}  ${valid_password}
    Click Button  ${login_button}
    Page Should Contain  Welcome, ${valid_username}

Verify Invalid Login
    [Documentation]  Test case to verify invalid login
    [Tags]  login
    Open Browser  ${url}  chrome
    Input Text  ${username_field}  ${invalid_username}
    Input Password  ${password_field}  ${invalid_password}
    Click Button  ${login_button}
    Page Should Contain  Invalid credentials error message
```    

### Test Execution and Reporting
Test execution and reporting involve running the test cases and generating detailed reports. It helps in tracking the test execution progress, identifying failures, and generating insights.
 
```bash
# Executing test cases
robot --outputdir results/ --log log.html --report report.html tests/
```

### Test Maintenance and Enhancement
Test maintenance and enhancement involve regularly updating and improving the test cases. It helps in adapting the tests to changes in the application and improving their efficiency.
  
```robotframework
# Enhancing a test case to include additional validations:
Verify Successful Login
    [Documentation]  Test case to verify successful login
    [Tags]  login
    Open Browser  ${url}  chrome
    Input Text  ${username_field}  ${valid_username}
    Input Password  ${password_field}  ${valid_password}
    Click Button  ${login_button}
    Page Should Contain  Welcome, ${valid_username}
    Element Should Be Visible  ${logout_button}
```

### Bug Tracking and Defect Reporting
Bug tracking and defect reporting involve identifying and documenting any issues found during testing.

> Example
- Using a bug tracking tool (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps) to log and track defects.
- Reporting defects with detailed steps to reproduce, screenshots, and expected/actual results.

### Test Data Management and Test Data Generation
Test data management and test data generation involve handling and generating test data for the project. It includes managing test data sources, generating test data, and ensuring data consistency.

> Example:
- Using a data management tool or database to store and retrieve test data.
- Generating test data dynamically using Python scripts or external tools.

### Code Review and Collaboration
Code review and collaboration involve reviewing and providing feedback on the automation code. It helps in ensuring code quality, adherence to best practices, and knowledge sharing.

> Example:
- Conducting code reviews with team members to identify improvements and potential issues.
- Collaborating on code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for version control and collaboration.

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
Documentation and knowledge sharing involve creating comprehensive documentation for the automation project. It includes documenting project setup, test cases, test execution instructions, and troubleshooting guides.

> Example:
- Creating documentation using Markdown, Wiki pages, or specialized documentation tools.
- Sharing knowledge through team meetings, presentations, or internal knowledge sharing platforms.

### Project Demo and Presentation
Project demo and presentation involve showcasing the automation project to stakeholders or clients. It helps in highlighting the project's accomplishments, demonstrating its effectiveness, and gathering feedback.

> Example:
- Preparing a presentation with project overview, goals, implementation details, and results.
- Conducting a live demo of the automation framework and test cases.
