# Section 1: Introduction to Python

## Quiz Questions
1.  **What is Python?**

*Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, and automation.*

2.  **What are some key features of Python?**

*Easy-to-read syntax, Dynamic typing, Automatic memory management, Extensive standard library, sCross-platform compatibility*

3.  **How do you define variables in Python?**

*Variables in Python are defined by assigning a value to a name. For example, `x = 10` assigns the value 10 to the variable `x`.*
    
4.  **What is the purpose of comments in Python?**

*Comments in Python are used to add explanatory notes to the code. They are not executed and help in improving code readability and documentation.*
    
5.  **What are the different data types in Python?**

*Python supports various data types, including: Integer (int), Float (float), String (str), Boolean (bool), List, Tuple, and Set (for collections), Dictionary (for key-value pairs)*

6.  **How do you perform mathematical operations in Python?**

*Python provides operators for common mathematical operations, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and exponentiation (\*\*).*
    
7.  **What are conditional statements in Python?**

*Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. The `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords are used to define conditional statements.*
    
8.  **How do you repeat code execution in Python?**

*Code can be repeated using loops in Python. The `for` loop and `while` loop are used to iterate over a sequence or execute code repeatedly until a condition is met.*
    
9.  **What is a function in Python?**

*A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It takes input (parameters) and may return a value. Functions help in organizing and modularizing code.*

10. **How do you handle errors and exceptions in Python?**

*Errors and exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks in Python. The code inside the `try` block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it is caught in the `except` block, allowing graceful error handling.*
