Collection of examples using the Robot Framework.

## How to install
1. Open the console or terminal on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Python project is located using the `cd` command.
3. If you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory, you can install all the dependencies listed in it by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file or want to install a specific dependency, you can use the `pip install` command followed by the name of the dependency. For example, to install the `robotframework` library, you would run the command `pip install robotframework`.
5. Once the installation is complete, you should be able to import and use the dependencies in your Python project.
